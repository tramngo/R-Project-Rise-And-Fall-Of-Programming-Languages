# R-Project-Rise-And-Fall-Of-Programming-Languages

In this project, I analyzed the relative popularity of programming languages over time, using a dataset from Stack Overflow. Using the R-package dplyr, I manipulated data and created a line plot. 

This project allowed me to apply skills from several DataCamp courses, including filtering, grouping and summarizing data, and visualizing with ggplot2.
